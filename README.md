# sas-studio-git-integration
With Git becoming the industry standard for source-code management, integrating Git into SAS Studio can streamline your software projects like never before. 
Join us for a hands-on workshop in which you learn how to effectively use Git with SAS Studio on the SAS Viya platform. 
In this workshop, you learn how to create Git profiles, clone repositories in SAS Studio, and push changes remotely. 
You learn how to seamlessly create or modify SAS and Python programs, SAS Studio flows, or custom steps and push the changes to your Git repository. 
With step-by-step guidance, you'll master key Git operations such as clone, pull, branch, stage, commit, merge, and push.
